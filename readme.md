# Dynamic Programming Review

DP is generally solved with
- recursion
- recursion + memoization
- tabulation

## Recursion
Recursion is a way of DP program solving with more concise but complex code. At times, it takes more CPU cycles for execution.

## Recursion + Memoization
Recursion + Memoization is a way of DP program solving with recursion and reducing repeatitive computation using memorization. 

## Tabulation 
Tabulation takes extra space but provides more readable implementation of problem solving.

Typically, the base-case is setup with default value and the table is evaluated in an expected order.
